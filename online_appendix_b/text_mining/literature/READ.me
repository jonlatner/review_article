## ~/text_mining/literature is an empty folder where individuals may put all 43 articles used in our review in pdf form.  As many of these articles are "locked," i.e. accessible only with a paywall from the publisher, we ourselves cannot do this for you.  However, we can make the "corpus," i.e. the raw text from the articles, available.
